# SuperPositionBetweenWaves
Well, I tried to make a very simple website that represents superposition. in the site we can see how the waves simultaneously exist but in a different phase. when you click on the screen - the superposition "collapses" - meaning you see one wave only. you can again "create" the superposition by clicking again with the mouse.
